# AI_algorithms

- Custom TSP environment with bi-directional, uniform-cost edges, and deterministic Frozen Lake environment from gymnasium.
- Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing optimization algorithms implemented on TSP.
- Branch and Bound, Iterative deepening A* search algorithms implemented on Frozen Lake
- Measures and compares average runtime over multiple runs.
- Aborts run after a specified timeout if no goal is reached.
- Visualizes final tours.
